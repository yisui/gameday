#' R package: gameday
#'
#' This package provides an easy way to access the data for NHL teams through R.
#'
#' There are two functions \code{gday(team, date)} and \code{scores(date)}
#' in the gameday package.
#' \code{gday(team, date)} checks whether a specified NHL team has a
#' game on a specified date. \code{scores(date)} displays the scores of
#' all the games on a specified date as a \code{data.frame}. \code{scores(date)} also
#' provides the information about whether the game can be watched on the "gamecenter" and
#' the stage of the games right now.
